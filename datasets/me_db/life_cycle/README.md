# Life Cycle

[Life Cycle](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/life-cycle-track-your-time/id1064955217?mt=8) 
is an iOS app for passive time tracking based on a phone's geolocation.

It samples the phone's location periodically and groups the data into a series
of durations spent in areas. By associating the areas with categories, the app
provides a breakdown of your day. 

Aggregating data from Life Cycle requires a manual export from the app. There
is a menu option to export a zipped CSV file of the app's database contents.
