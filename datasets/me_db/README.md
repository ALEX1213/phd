A tool to aggregate personal data from several sources to enable data-driven
decision making.

## Data sources supported

* [LifeCycle](/datasets/me_db/providers/life_cycle) time tracking data.
* [HealthKit](/datasets/me_db/providers/health_kit) iPhone and Apple Watch measurements.
* [YNAB](/datasets/me_db/providers/ynab) budgeting and transactions ledger.


### Future plans

I have plans to add support for the following additional sources:

* Google Calendar - duration and times of calendar events.
* OmniFocus - number of tasks completed / added per day.
* Timing.app - time tracking from macOS.
